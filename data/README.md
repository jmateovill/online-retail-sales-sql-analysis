## Data Source

This project uses the Online Retail Data Set from UCI ML repo.

Raw and cleaned data files are excluded due to file size constraints.

To reproduce this analysis:
1. Download the dataset from *Kaggle*: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jihyeseo/online-retail-data-set-from-uci-ml-repo
2. Clean the data by running the **Data Cleaning** script in my previous [R Project Analysis](https://github.com/jmateovill/online-retail-sales-analysis/tree/main/scripts)
3. Export the cleaned dataset as CSV
4. Import it into SQLite to generate the database used here
