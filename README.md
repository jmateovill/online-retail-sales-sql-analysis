Analysis on Online Retail Sales Data by Using SQL queries

Database created locally using the cleaned Online Retail Data Set from UCI ML repo. 
Cleaned dataset came from my R project that utilizes the same dataset.
Added a "Revenue" column ("Quantity" * "UnitPrice").
Eliminates invalid records by removing negative values from "Quantity" and "Unit Price" columns.
